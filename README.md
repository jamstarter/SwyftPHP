SwyftPHP
========

Swyft is an Open Source PHP micro-Framework that packs a punch. With a small footprint, easy configuration and simple syntax, Swyft can be used for applications of any scale. It is easy to customize and easy to extend with libraries from other frameworks, like Zend or CodeIgniter. Swyft was designed with two things in mind:

    Keep it Small - There's no need for libraries taking up space and resources if we never use them
    Keep it Simple - PHP doesn't need to be difficult. Do things the way that makes sense
